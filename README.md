# AgImpacts
This is the source code for our interactive web tool which is a part of AgImpacts, a project conducted by ten MIT undergraduates for the World Wildlife Fund. AgImpacts analyzes environmental trade-offs for ten agricultural commodities across five indicators: GHG emissions, land use, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and freshwater withdrawal. To learn more about these topics and our project, [visit the AgImpacts website.](https://agimpacts.wpengine.com/)
For queries about the source code or web tool, contact Anushree Chaudhuri (anuc@mit.edu). For information on the current state of this work, contact Emily Moberg (emily.a.moberg@gmail.com) of the World Wildlife Fund.
